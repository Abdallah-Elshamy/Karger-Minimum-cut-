# Karger-Minimum-cut-
An implementation for Karger Minimum cut  algorithem

The file "kargerMinCut.txt" contains the adjacency list representation of a simple undirected graph. There are 200 vertices labeled 1 to 200. The first column in the file represents the vertex label, and the particular row (other entries except the first column) tells all the vertices that the vertex is adjacent to. So for example, the 6th6^{th}6th row looks like : "6 155 56 52 120 ......". This just means that the vertex with label 6 is adjacent to (i.e., shares an edge with) the vertices with labels 155,56,52,120,......,etc

this code runs the randomized contraction algorithm for the min cut problem and uses it on the above graph to compute the min cut.
